# Binary to Decimal CLI

This is a simple command-line application written in TypeScript that converts binary numbers to decimal.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- TypeScript (installed as a dev dependency)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Start the CLI application
```bash
npm start
```
You will be prompted to enter a binary number with up to 8 digits (consisting of 0s and 1s).
The program will then output the corresponding decimal value.


## Notes

Only valid binary numbers are accepted. If you enter invalid input (like letters or other digits), the program will ask you to try again.
